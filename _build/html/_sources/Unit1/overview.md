Overview
=======================

In this chapter, we will learn about the classroom routines
that we will use this year. These routines may feel a little weird at first
because they are unlike many of the routines you have experienced in
your other classes. How so? Well, consider how you often learn in your other
classes. I bet it goes a little something like this:
1. Lecture -- Some teacher tries to get you to learn by talking at you. 
Boring.
2. Homework -- After some teacher talks at you for what feels like FOREVER,
 they tell you to go home and think about it some more. Lame.
3. Exam -- At the end of the semester, they give you some crazy hard test that
 covers all of the stuff they "supposedly" talked about in lecture. Lies!

Sound familiar? If so, you're not alone! I have taught like this before and
frankly, it doesn't work. And why would it? I can't dump understanding into
your brain; only you can do that!

So how are you going to learn this year? One word, <b>feedback</b>. I will flip
the traditional classroom model by using our lectures to figure out what
you know and what you might need help with. This will feel strange at first,
but I promise, with a bit of time, you will begin to see how much better this system
is for learning.

So let's dive in and see exactly what we're doing this year!
