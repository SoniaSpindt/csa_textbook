Integers and Doubles
====================

Now, in your Algebra class, it's kind of assumed that the values that variables can be assigned to are numbers --- makes sense, it is a math class after all. However, in computer science, the collection of values that a variable can be assigned to is much larger. We will learn about all of them over the next few weeks. For now, we're going to stick with what we know, numbers!

I want you to notice the strange little `int` word from the example on the previous page:
```Java
  int x = 3;
```
This keyword tells our computer what <b><i>type</i></b> of value can be found in the variable; in the example above, the type of the variable `x` is an integer because 3 is an integer.
