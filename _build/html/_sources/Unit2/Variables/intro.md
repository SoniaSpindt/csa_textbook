Intro to Variables
==================

It's time to learn how to create attributes within our Java programs! The way we do this is with a programming concept called <b><i>variables</i></b>. Does this term sound super familiar to you? It's possible that you heard about it in your Algebra class, which is a class all about variables! The variables you learned about in your Algebra class are very similar to the variables that you will see and create in this class; in both cases, <b><i>they are the names we give values</i></b>.

For example, you may have seen a simple equation in your Algebra class that looks like this:

```Java
  x = 3
```

If I asked you "What is x?" you would (hopefully) answer with "3". See, the name `x` is given to the value `3`! We will do the same thing in this class, except it will look something like this:
```Java
  int x = 3;
```
As you can see, this line of code is a statement[^*]! Remember, that means we are asking our computer to do something. But what exactly are we asking it to do? Well, we are asking our computer to associate the name `x` with the value `3`. So, when I ask you what `x` is in this class, you can respond with "x is 3", or "x gets 3", or "x is assigned to 3". All of these responses are valid and they all mean the same thing.

I prefer the last response, "x is assigned to 3", because this secretly refers to the name computer scientists give the equal sign; they call it the <b><i>assignment operator</i></b>. The assignment operator is responsible for actually telling our computer that you ship a particular name and value.

<br>Remember how I said it was important to know a little bit about how your computer works when learning to program? We want to keep thinking about this as we learn new stuff because it will help make your prediction skills sharp[^**]. Most of the time, this involves me drawing pretty pictures. :P So here's a picture of how your computer might "think" about variables:

<br>Your computer actually has a memory system like you and I do, and just like our memory system, our computer's memory is used to store information that can be used later on. A computer's memory is far less complex than the memory system found in our brains, and can literally be thought of as boxes or containers that store something for later; this is why many people say that variables "store" values in them. If it helps you to think of a variable as a little box used to store a value, then cool! You do you, boo. :)
