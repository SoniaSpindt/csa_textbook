    "Because ArrayLists were added later on, they are not a part of the standard Java library. This means our computers will have no idea what you're talking about until you import the ArrayList class. Importing classes gives your program access to them, which means that you can use them in your program. When you want to use ArrayLists, you write the statement `import java.util.ArrayList` at the very top of your program. This line of code will always live at the top of your program, and once you add it, you can <b><i>instantiate</i></b> as many ArrayList objects in your program as you would like (Yup, ArrayLists are objects!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like arrays, you cannot mix data types in ArrayLists. In fact, Java is especially picky when it comes to naming the types of values to be stored within an ArrayLists; in a perfect world, you are able to name it twice, once on either side of the assignment operator[^*]. The type of values stored within an ArrayList will always go within angle brackets (`<>`). In the example above, String objects are found in the `brands` ArrayList. I know this because the keyword `String` is contained within the angle brackets. This also means, that `brands` will only ever contain String objects. However, if you were to leave this blank (aka not include the keyword `String` inside of the angle brackets), then your compiler will assume that you wanted to use the most generic type possible in the Java programming language, `Object`. Here is an example of what I mean:"

    "In this case, the type of objects stored in `brands` will be `Object`, not `String`. The 'Object' class is the mother of all object types in Java; every class (like the ArrayList class and the String class) are derived from the 'Object' class. Although your compiler won't yell at you for leaving the type blank in this case, many professional Java programmers will! It's always best to be as specific and explicit as possible because this will result in fewer errors on your part.  \n",
