    "When we need to store multiple values in a single variable we use something called an <b><i>array</i></b> in Java. How are they used? Pay attention to how I declared the sneakers variable: `String[] sneakers`. It looks a lot like how we declare reference variables for Strings! However, if you squint really hard, you'll notice that there are now square brackets (`[]`) after the keyword `String`. The square brackets are how we let our computer know that we plan on initializing `sneakers` to a list of String objects, instead of single String.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization is also very similar to what we have seen so far. In this case, all you need to do is list every value that you would like to use in between a pair of curly braces (`{}`). The commas are important to include within your list because they separate the values from one other. Everything else about our data types is the same; booleans are never capitalized, Strings must be contained within quotes, and your numbers are either integers or decimal values.\n",
