Complex Method Design
=====================

You will spend most of your time as a programmer defining and redefining methods. Why? Think about it. A program is nothing more than a bucket of information and a handful of tools that we can use in order to access and manipulate that information. If we develop and improve the tools that we use to interact with said information, then we can do some pretty crazy things! Basically, methods are the bread and butter of your programs.

So it's important to make sure that you are equipped with the knowledge you need to define these crazy methods. We will spend the next unit learning how to make our methods more complex, and consequently, more powerful. However, the basics we learned about in Unit 3 will never change! So hold onto those fundamentals because they are still very useful to know.
